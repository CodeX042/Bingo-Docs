## Overview

The Metamuse frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite to ensure high-performance development. It leverages **Thirdweb** and **web3.js** for blockchain interactions, enabling NFT minting for collaborative artwork. Artists collaborate on a **Konva**-based canvas, and their work appears in a marketplace where users can place real-time bids.
