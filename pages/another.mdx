Overview
The Metamuse frontend is built using React with TypeScript and Vite for a high-performance development environment. It leverages Thirdweb and web3.js for blockchain interactions, enabling minting of collaborative artwork as NFTs. Artists can collaborate on a Konva-based canvas and view artwork in a marketplace where users can bid in real time.

Core Components
1. Canvas
Built with Konva.
Includes basic drawing tools (brush, shapes, colors).
Saves collaborative artwork data locally and on the blockchain.
2. Marketplace
Fetches and displays minted artworks.
Enables bidding through Socket.IO.
3. Notifications
React-toastify is used for success, error, and bidding notifications.
4. User Authentication
Uses Thirdweb for Web3 authentication.
5. Minting
Integrates web3.js and Thirdweb to mint completed artworks as NFTs.
NFTs appear on the marketplace post-minting.
State Management
Tacstack is used to manage global states, ensuring a smooth flow of data between components.
Component-specific states (e.g., artwork data, bid status) are localized to reduce re-rendering.
Socket and Real-time Communication
Socket.IO-Client is utilized to manage real-time events:

Collaboration on canvas.
Live bidding updates in the marketplace.
Notifications for bid increments and outbid events.
Ensure the Socket.IO server URL is set in .env.

Web3 Integration
Thirdweb
Thirdweb handles:
NFT minting process.
Authentication and wallet management.
Web3.js
Web3.js is used for:
Transaction management and wallet connection.
Contract interaction for bidding and transfers.
UI Components and Styling
Icons

Provided by Lucide-react for uniform iconography.
Styling

Built with Tailwind CSS.
