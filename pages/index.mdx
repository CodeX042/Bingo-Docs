BinGo Overview
BinGo is a decentralized web application built entirely on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to revolutionize recycling. The platform allows users to upload images of waste items, which are analyzed by an AI model to classify them as recyclable or non-recyclable. Users who recycle eligible materials are rewarded with payments, and local recycling stations are notified for pickups.

Key Features
AI-Powered Waste Classification: Users upload images of waste, and AI classifies them as recyclable or not, with high accuracy.
Decentralized Transactions: All user rewards and transactions are securely processed and recorded on the ICP blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
Incentive System: Users are financially rewarded for recycling plastic, paper, metals, and other recyclable materials.
Recycling Station Notifications: The system notifies nearby recycling stations to collect the recyclables, streamlining the process.
How It Works
Users upload waste images via the web app.
The AI classifies the items as recyclable or non-recyclable.
If recyclable, users are rewarded through blockchain-based transactions.
The platform notifies recycling centers to pick up the materials, ensuring efficient waste management.
Why ICP?
By building on ICP, BinGo ensures:

Decentralization: No central authority controls the platform; everything is handled by a decentralized network.
Security & Transparency: All transactions (payments, recycling logs) are securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full transparency and trust.
Scalability: The platform can scale easily without the limitations of traditional servers, providing fast and seamless user experiences.
Technology Stack
Frontend: Built with ICP Web Integration for the user interface.
Backend: Fully decentralized and deployed on ICP.
AI Service: Waste classification powered by AI/ML models on the decentralized platform.
Objective
The goal of BinGo is to create a decentralized, transparent, and rewarding recycling system that encourages users to recycle more, while ensuring a fair and secure process through ICP blockchain technology.
