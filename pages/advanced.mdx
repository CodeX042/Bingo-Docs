# Backend API for Team Codex - Blockathon

## Introduction
This project is a backend server for a real-time collaborative drawing application. It allows multiple users to draw simultaneously on a shared canvas, facilitating creativity and collaboration.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to solve two problems: 
1. Difficulty of real-time artist collaboration digitally. 
2. Enabling seamless, on-chain payments. This eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, allowing artists to collaborate and transact directly in a decentralized manner.

## Features
- Real-time drawing updates
- User authentication
- On-chain payment integration
- Undo and redo functionality
- Support for multiple drawing tools (pen, eraser, shapes)
- Color selection and fill options
- Canvas sharing with unique room IDs

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: For the server-side application
- **Express**: To handle HTTP requests
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication and drawing functionality
- **MongoDB**: For data management and user data storage
- **Postman**: For testing API endpoints
- **VSCode**: For code editing and development
- **Render.com**: For hosting the API

## Installation
